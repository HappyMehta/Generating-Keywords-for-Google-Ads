# Generating-Keywords-for-Google-Ads

## Project Overview

This Datacamp project involves creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns related to the sofas section of a massive online furniture retailer. By combining relevant words with product names, we'll generate potential keywords using Python and pandas library.

## Project Tasks

2. **Combine Words with Product Names**: Combine relevant words with the product names to form potential keywords.
3. **Convert to DataFrame**: Transform the list of lists into a Pandas DataFrame.
4. **Column Renaming**: Rename the columns in the DataFrame.
5. **Add Campaign Information**: Include a campaign column.
6. **Create Match Types**: Generate match type information for the keywords.
